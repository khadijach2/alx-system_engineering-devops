Setup SFTP Server: Ensure you have access to an SFTP server or have one set up where you want to transfer files.

Install SFTP Client: Use an SFTP client software or command-line tool on your local machine. Popular ones include FileZilla, WinSCP (Windows), Cyberduck (Mac), or the sftp command in Unix-based systems.

Connect to the Server: Open your SFTP client and enter the server's details (hostname or IP address, port number, username, and password or SSH key) to establish a connection.

Navigate to the Directory: Once connected, navigate through the directory structure to locate the files you want to transfer. Use cd command to change directories if needed.

Transfer Files: Use the appropriate command or feature in your client to upload or download files. For instance, in the command line, you'd typically use put to upload files and get to download files.

Verify Transfer: After the transfer, ensure that the files have been successfully transferred by checking their presence and integrity on both the local and remote systems.

Disconnect: Properly close the connection to the SFTP server through your client to ensure security and resource efficiency.
